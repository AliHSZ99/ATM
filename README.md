# ATM

This is a project about an ATM machine simulator that contains 3 accounts. 
It is an ATM machine simulator.We created an Account class with all the 
attributes that characterizes a bank account, with all the methods needed, and 
other service classes such as MoneyConversion class and AdminAccount class. 
We provided operations such as deposit, withdraw, transfer between accounts, print
balance and more with nice outputs for better user experience. The Accounts service
class helps for account management and nice outputs. The MoneyConversion service class
helps perform money conversions from CAN to USD or EUR. Finally, the AdminAccount is
used to manage an admin's account and has their own rights on the machines that users
do not have.

# Challenge Problem 

It is a program to give the least amount of bills from a withdrawal. It lets
the user choose if he wants to receive $100 bills and/or $50 bills depending
on the withdrawal amount. This will print the amount of bills a user will
receive on their receipt when they decide to withdraw.
